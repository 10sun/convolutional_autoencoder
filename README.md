# convolutional_autoencoder
Code for a convolutional autoencoder written on python, theano, lasagne, nolearn

I highly recommend you use the ipython notebook to run this, if you just need code to read, look at the python file.

Due to the fact that the newest versions of theano, nolearn and lasagne are sometimes in conflict, it is recommended that one works in a virtualenv (see http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/).  Then one can install a set of modules that are compatible using pip install -r https://github.com/mikesj-public/convolutional_autoencoder/blob/master/requirements.txt
